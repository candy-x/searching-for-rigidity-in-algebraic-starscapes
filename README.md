# searching-for-rigidity-in-algebraic-starscapes

This is the complementary gallery and code library for the paper *Searching for Rigidity in Algebraic Starscapes* co-authored by Gabriel Dorfsman-Hopkins and Candy Xu. 

**Abstract**

We create plots of algebraic integers in the complex plane, exploring the effect of sizing the integers according to various arithmetic invariants. We focus on Galois theoretic invariants, in particular creating plots which emphasize algebraic integers whose Galois group is not the full symmetric groupâˆ’these integers we call rigid. We then give some analysis of the resulting images, suggesting avenues for future research about the geometry of so-called rigid algebraic integers.
